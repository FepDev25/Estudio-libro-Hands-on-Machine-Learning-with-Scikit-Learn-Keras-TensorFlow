# End-to-End Machine Learning Project

- Main steps of a machine learning project:
  1. Look at the big picture.
  2. Get the data.
  3. Explore and visualize the data to gain insights.
  4. Prepare the data for machine learning algorithms.
  5. Select a model and train it.
  6. Fine-tune your model.
  7. Present your solution.
  8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.

## Working with Real Data
